This is a dynamic navigation which will be used within my Admin package. Feel free to fork this and try it out for yourself.
  If you have any problems then please feel free to ask me any questions. This can be implemented into any package, but I will
  release some documentation later on once I have used it with my admin package.

  I would like to thank [Josh Benham](https://github.com/joshbenham) for his help and support. (He did create this himself,
  I have just stolen it from him, but will hope to make it my own).
